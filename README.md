## Inspiration

What inspired us is the personal stories surrounding misdiagnoses or dismissive initial consultations experienced by people close to us. In many cases, critical conditions were overlooked because the right questions werenâ€™t asked, or certain aspects weren't scrutinized thoroughly. We understand the immense workload on doctors who see hundreds of patients and can't delve into every single detail. This is where we saw a need for HealthEcho - to empower doctors to provide each patient with the personalized attention and analysis they deserve. 

## What it does

In its essence, HealthEcho is an assistant that gives non-intrusive second opinions to doctors, ensuring no stone is left unturned in the diagnostic journey. We leverage the powerful natural language understanding capabilities of Claude-2 (Anthropic) to analyze doctor-patient consultations, extract relevant medical knowledge, and engage doctors in insightful dialogues upon request. HealthEcho aims to uncover overlooked diagnostic angles, ensuring a thorough understanding and personalized decision-making in patient care.

To enhance the medical knowledge of Claude-2, we leverage trust-worthy medical resources such as National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, GP Notebook and textbooks to enriched context. We combine traditional word-based search with vector search to ensure a diversity of relevant information is retrieved.
